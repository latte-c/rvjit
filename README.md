# RvJIT

RvJIT is a rv64 jit engine and assembler written in rust.

## Build

Since this is only a library, there's no need to **build** it. If your are going to test it, see the following description.

## Test

Test scripts are generated from table. If you want to config the test, just modify the `script/test.py` and re-generate test. Then,

```
cargo test
```

to perform all tests.

## Contribution

Most codes are auto-generated by scripts. If you want to add new instruction, modify `rv*.txt` in `script`. If you want to fix bugs and add new routine for code generation, modify `script/generate.py`.

## Documentation

I don't think there's need apart from reading the `RISCV ISA Manual`. If you want to read the specification, just go for the official webpage.

## Convention

We try to follow the order of riscv assembly language, which means things should be appeared in the following order:

```
rd, rs1, rd2
```
